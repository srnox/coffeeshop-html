Welcome to our coffee website project!

This website is designed to showcase the best coffee beans from around the world. The website allows users to browse and purchase different types of coffee beans, read about the beans' origin and flavor profile, and also leave reviews.

The website is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We have used JavaScript for building an interactive and responsive user interface and the back-end logic.

We have used local storage to store the data and used javascript to handle the user interactions and data manipulation.

This project is open-source and we welcome any contributions or suggestions. If you're interested in helping out, please check out our contributing guidelines.

Thank you for visiting our website and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it.

Cheers!
